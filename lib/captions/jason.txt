Yeah... that's definitely a thing
I feel like we have the technology to do this
You don't know the history of pixels like I do...
This mission... just got a heck of a lot more impossibler...
Chipotle completes me... kind of like that deaf person in Jerry Maguire
I feel like bacon goes good with about anything
I feel like 17 shades of gray is a good thing
I might just have to go to Starbucks
Friend-zone-first is my middle name
"a lot of extra unnecessary words" is my middle name
Does Starbucks have internet?
Coffee is wondrous
Ignorance is bliss if you're ignorant
